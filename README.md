# 🧾 QueueCTL — CLI-Based Background Job Queue System

A lightweight **command-line job queue system** built using **Node.js** and **TypeScript**.  
QueueCTL allows you to add background jobs, execute them using workers, retry failed tasks automatically with exponential backoff, and manage permanently failed jobs through a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** — all from the command line.
